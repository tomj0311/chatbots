# Chatbots
Artificial Intelligence based technologies to live easier.

We use different kinds of Artificial Intelligence based technologie for faster and more interconnected lives. A popular form of Artificial Intelligence is a bot, a software programmed that can develop a number of tasks on its own and without the help of humans. 

## Summary
History of chatbots dates back to 1966 when a computer program called ELIZA was invented by Weizenbaum, It was a natural language processing computer program created from 1964 to 1966.ELIZA is considered to be the first chatterbot in the history of computer science. Though the term chatterbot was not even coined then. Eliza parodies a Rogerian therapist, largely by rephrasing many of the patient's statements as questions and posing them to the patient. Thus, for example, the response to "My head hurts" might be "Why do you say your head hurts?" The response to "My mother hates me" might be "Who else in your family hates you?" ELIZA was named after Eliza Doolittle, a working-class character in George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion, who is taught to speak with an upper class accent.
