# Chatbots
We use different kinds of Artificial Intelligence based technologie to live easier, faster and more interconnected lives. A popular form of Artificial Intelligence is a bot, a software programmed that can develop a number of tasks on its own and without the help of humans. 

## Summary
History of chatbots dates back to 1966 when a computer program called ELIZA was invented by Weizenbaum, It was a natural language processing computer program created from 1964 to 1966.ELIZA is considered to be the first chatterbot in the history of computer science. Though the term chatterbot was not even coined then. Eliza parodies a Rogerian therapist, largely by rephrasing many of the patient's statements as questions and posing them to the patient. Thus, for example, the response to "My head hurts" might be "Why do you say your head hurts?" The response to "My mother hates me" might be "Who else in your family hates you?" ELIZA was named after Eliza Doolittle, a working-class character in George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion, who is taught to speak with an upper class accent. 

Cleverbot a successful follower of ELIZA, comes very close to passing the Turing Test Techniche 2011, IIT Guwahati, India, 3rd September 2011.

WeChats Xiaoice (pronounced Shao-ice): Another old favorite it’s an artificial intelligence program designed to chat with people. Its available for users of WeChat and platforms like Weibo or JD.com can talk to her about any topic that comes to mind. The only requirement is to do it in Chinese

Over the last ten years, the number of available apps has exploded — there is now an app for pretty much anything you can think of. But as our devices become increasingly cluttered with countless separate items, each performing their own function, we are slowly reaching saturation point. Managing our lives means switching endlessly from app to app.

Chatbots simplify processes by acting as our digital helpers. Instead of using different apps for different functions, the chatbot provides a single, interactive layer between you and the information or outcome you seek.

So I am here to create couple of chatbos from simple to the complex ones, This repository will also contains utility functions created during the process. 

## Intelligent chatbots
Powered by AI — get smarter with time. They use machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to improve their performance autonomously, without the need for further programming or updates.

Smartloop is an Enterprise-level chatbot management software which can be hosted behind your firewall. It uses Rasa (open source and hostable behind your firewall) as it’s NLP engine , which means that you all of your data will be yours, behind your firewall and compliant with HIPPA, GDPR, and SOC.
